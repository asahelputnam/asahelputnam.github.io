## New Mexico

Altitude and sleepiness have somewhat lifted from the place, but where their silken shawls had pooled, the empty air of Santa Fe is only more alien to this NewEnglander. New England is a feat of punctuation. In this New Mexico palace of mud, where I sit by the window on a rocking, floating, lamb laden bed, in the less mediated yet somehow softer light, interiority is precious. Houses and forests of oak and white pine, contain like nothing else. Free association of adobe and skrub run unhindered all the way to distant blue, enclosing only the sky. Where Monadnock is the sacred exception to the taboo, the ultimate enclosure of all beneath, these mountains only further open the scene. 
	
Moving to the courtyard now, light falls gently on a wall with a window looking into the kitchen and a young ceramic girl in blue. Shadows from a crab apple tree hang festive. Two chickens peck around the base. There is a basin with a pipe above it, delivering water from the kitchen sink. As the pipe drips, the water ripples, and projections of refractions slip across the wall.

On the other side of the glass, the light gives an ocean’s floor silent animation to the jars and forks and potted plants which crowd around the sink. Swaying passively with slight currents, filled and animated now and again by rays from far above, the dishes on the drying rack glitter with that submarine romance— and yet are right here! as intimate as my hand. 

Santa riding with the starlink, christmas eve. Splinter in my palm the next morning.
