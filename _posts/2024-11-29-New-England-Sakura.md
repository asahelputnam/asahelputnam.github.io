## New England Sakura

Top of that big sycamore by the water, bark flakes with the season. Sycamore balls and last brittle leaves set against the bright blue look like that kind of trite, procedural art there are tutorials for on tick tock, or like a masterpiece print of cherry blossoms. The kind of thing that, if it was art, I could only worship or completely dismiss. But these balls are framed only against the sky, and only because I turned my head upwards to isolate them.

On the water pond, a column of golden blindness falls about half way across the water. Around it, smaller dazzles catch in ripples. From the right, a procession of Canadian geese slowly comes to meet the sun at a perpendicular. They will soon be in front of my tree.
Waiting, I look at the tree below me. Flattened by perspective, it opens up, radiating like an anemone. The romance of heights gets to me slightly, and I wonder if I will get to see the birds leave all at once.

Sometimes in the past weeks the geese on the edges of the pond have looked aimless to me, but in their solidarity now they are assured and dignified. They move slowly, regarding all with the security of knowing one’s place. The group is led by a lone pair. Hierarchy? Love? Ostracisation? Those two pass out from behind a branch, into the still water shadowed by the sycamore.
Silently they slow and fan out beneath the tree. Do they see me? But surely they are only paying respects to the sycamore. They join the flock hanging around me from the twigs, now framed against a darker blue. —

—-A pair from across the water breaks for the sky. Splashing, beating, then in the air and the court is honking along with them, flying past on level with me, going somewhere in a great hurry. Their excitement for the journey is palpable, like storm air, and they are gone behind trees and a steeple and apartment buildings. My hopes of seeing the greater group leave, and the fantasy that it is all for my benefit is fanned higher.

The congregation beneath and around me continues honking, and bracing in the wind, like good new englanders, for a while after the pair is beyond my sight. When they die down, the geese resume their procession and the sycamore balls go back to their pretentious composition, posing in front of the sky. The leaders (the same? Or new ones?) tack back out towards the center of the pond, and continue the course towards perpendicular intersection with the blinding beacon, already lower in the sky and shorter across the water.
The geese pass now before the sun!, behind the screen of hanging posers. Just ahead of the blind area, they create a different frequency of ripples in the water, extending white gold in their sequined suits. —

—-But back on the ground, New England is a practical place. The geese are still there, now in a less organised grouped, loitering in the now long shadows across the pond. They probably aren't even migratory geese, fat from bread crumbs and luxurious summers spent shitting on suburban lawns— descendants of captives of 1920s waterfowl hunters, says mass.gov. Even so, walking home with my fuzzy guitar music in headphones, I'm in a good mood, and I smile at the shimmering willow leaves over the water.
