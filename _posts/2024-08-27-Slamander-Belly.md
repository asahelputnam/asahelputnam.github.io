## Salamander Belly 
Biking on the boardwalk over to Tamper Cafe, I lower my gaze to the wooden planks and they start strobing. Ahead of me, things move continuously closer. On the ground around my front tire, where my eyes don't even try to track the passing of each shape on the ground, each image appears as if from nowhere, and escapes before its shape can be assigned to a permanent object. My eyes drift between these worlds and become confused. The rhythm required to follow one throws the other out of sync. The boards in the space before me shudder hypnotically. I look up. 
	
The belly of a  salamander integrates my mody. The damp surface embraces me. My eyes poke out as two more pours. She moves across some other great body. I encounter this other animal in details: the discontinuous colors of its skin, and in the sensations of its texture catching on mine— or ours, the salamander and I.

An old acquaintance in a coffee shop asks me how these creatures move. I conjure faint images. They float on the skin of that other creature like the spots that precede a migraine. I say something intelligent about them. Something on the surface of the other creature passes behind my visions and they magnify it, filling themselves with its iridescent light. I talk excitedly about the progress of my hostess towards some important point, that is to say, talk excitedly about that speck of iridescent dust. The dust passes, my visions magnify the worries of some ugly crevasse, and I bemoan the amphibian’s wandering course. I watch the immediate surface of another person as she talks of far away things, and soon my attention fails to follow her across the gap. Her face seems strange to me.

I look up acceptance rates for colleges. I press myself painstakingly into the webpage. Meditating badly, I identify vague feelings about simple things. I look for anything there about the world I see through images of horror on instagram, and am ashamed to find nothing except the shame. This shame and nausea reveal themselves to be gastrointestinal, passing with a burp.

I drink coffee and see all kinds of fractal worlds on the other creature’s pores, and get very exited.
